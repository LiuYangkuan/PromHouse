# PromHouse

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Percona-Lab/PromHouse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Percona-Lab/PromHouse)

PromHouse is a long-term remote storage with built-in clustering and downsampling for Prometheus 2.0 on top of
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.yandex). Or, rather, it will be someday. Right now it's buggy and slow work-in-progress.
Feel free to ~~like, share, retweet,~~ star and watch it, but **do not use it in production**.
