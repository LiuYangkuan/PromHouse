PromHouse is a long-term remote storage with built-in clustering and downsampling for Prometheus 1 and 2 on top of
[ClickHouse](https://clickhouse.yandex). Or, rather, it will be someday.
Feel free to ~~like, share, retweet,~~ star and watch it, but **do not use it in production** yet.

It requires Go 1.9+.
